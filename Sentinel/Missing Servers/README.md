# Missing Servers

Created python script to sift through spreadsheet of client servers (could be anything) that should be showing up in Microsoft Sentinel compared to the ones shown in Microsoft Sentinel. 

Good idea to run the kql query first to get rid of the domain name thats concatenated to the server name.
